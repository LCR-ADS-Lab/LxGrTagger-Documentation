#### Verb complement
Consider the following sets of sentences:
- *a. Louise abandoned the project.*
- *b. Louise abandoned.*
- *c. Louise abandoned after the project.*
- *d. Louise abandoned the book.*
- *e. Louise abandoned the project then the book.*

From the given examples, we can draw the conclusion that the verb *abandon* must be accompanied by a constituent of a certain type, there, *the project*. *The project* is called a noun phrase (NP). If the verb *abandon* is not associated with a noun phrase, then the sentence in which it occurs is not well-formed. We will say that to complete a sentence which contains the verb *abandon*, we need a complement of the category NP.
