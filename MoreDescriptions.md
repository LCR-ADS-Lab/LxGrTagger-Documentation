#### 1. Verb complement 
- Reference: Haegeman & Gu√©ron, 1998, pp. 21-22
- Consider the following sets of sentences:
    - *a. He abandoned the project.*
    - *b. He abandoned.*
    - *c. He abandoned after the project.*
    - *d. He abandoned the book.*
    - *e. He abandoned the project then the book.*

- From the given examples, we can conclude that the verb *abandon* must be accompanied by a constituent of a certain type, there, *the project*. *The project* is called a noun phrase (NP). If the verb *abandon* is not associated with a NP, then the sentence in which it occurs is not well-formed. We will say that to complete a sentence which contains the verb *abandon*, we need a complement of the category NP.

#### 2. NP complement
- Compare the following sets of sentences:
    - *He considers <ins>that she **deserves** a promotion</ins>.* (verb-complement)
    - *The consideration <ins>that she **deserves** a promotion</ins>weighs heavily on his mind.* (NP-complement)
    - *She believes <ins>that honesty **is** the best policy</ins>.* (verb-complement)
    - *Her belief <ins>that honesty **is** the best policy</ins> guides her actions.* (NP-complement)
