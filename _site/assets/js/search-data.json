Finite (dependent) adverbial clauses . Finite adverbial clauses enrich sentences by providing detailed and complex information through various syntactic functions and complexity features. Following are some characteristics (pp. 826-828). | Finite adverbial clauses typically require a subordinator and articulate a broad spectrum of semantic relationships such as time, manner, reason/cause, result, concession, and condition. | Finite clauses have the advantage of an explicitly stated subject, allowing for different subjects in the adverbial and main clauses, enriching the information conveyed. In contrast, non-finite clauses often lack an explicit subject, usually assuming the subject of the main clause. | Finite clauses enable diverse tense or modality marking within the adverbial clause, distinct from the main clause, crucial for expressing various semantic relationships. The use of different tenses or modalities in the adverbial and main clauses illustrates time, purpose, concession, and reason. Hypothetical conditional clauses (e.g., if) utilize tense and modality differences to express hypothetical meanings. | . ",

The NP preceding the ING-verbs is functioning as the subject of the non-finite clause. | . | Feeling rather foolish after having been so easily caught in my attempt to escape from him, which was rather mean since he was a guest and there was no need for me to be ill-mannered just because he was, I agreed. | Q: Is … having been caught … an ing-clause? ed-clause?

If not, are both just sacked and resigned examples of an ed-clause as adverbial? | A: This looks like creative writing, and the author is playing with grammar. We’d say ‘just sacked’ is a non-finite ed-adverbial clause. And ‘resigned’ looks parallel. But it is not possible for someone to ‘BE resigned’ in the sense that they were sacked. So, the guess ‘resigned’ is an adjective – although it seems the author is intending for us to understand that this has a passive-voice sense (i.e. the person ‘was resigned’ by someone). | . | . Adverbial clauses . | Adverbial clauses modify the main clause by providing additional information such as time, reason, condition, concession, and manner. Commonly introduced by subordinating conjunctions, adverbial clauses are dependent clauses that cannot stand alone as complete sentences. | These clauses can appear in various positions within the sentence, either at the beginning, middle, or end, depending on the emphasis and rhythm desired in the discourse. | .

(dataset) | . | . Complements . Complements are often required to form a grammatically complete and meaningful sentence. Consider the following examples, where grammatically incorrect sentences are indicated with * (Haegeman &amp; Guéron, 1998, pp. 21-22): . | a. He abandoned the project. | b. *He abandoned. | c. *He abandoned after the project. | d. He abandoned the book. | e. He abandoned the project, then the book. | . These examples show that the verb abandon must be followed by a noun phrase (e.g., the project). If the verb is not accompanied by a noun phrase, the sentence is incomplete and therefore ungrammatical (as seen in examples b and c). Verb complement clauses . Verb complement clauses are dependent clauses that serve to complete the meaning of a verb in a main clause (e.g., I think that this doc looks good; that-clause functions a complement to the verb think). These clauses are also called nominal clauses because they frequently occupy a noun phrase slot in the sentence, acting as subjects, objects, or predicatives. Depending on the controlling predicate, they can be found in both pre-predicate (subject) and post-predicate (e.g., direct object) positions (For more information, see Chapter 9). However, complement clauses can also complete the meaning of an adjectival predicate rather than a verb in the main clause (e.g., I’ve gotta be careful that I don’t sound too formal). Here, the term predicate refers to both lexical verbs and copula+adjective combinations capable of governing a complement clause. This aspect will be further explored in the section on other phrase constituent: adjective complement. There are four types of verb complement clauses: (1) that-clause, (2) wh-clause, (3) to-infinitive clause, and (4) ing-clause. In this section, (1) and (2) are discussed because they are finite clauses, while (3) and (4) will be discussed in the section on non-finite clause constituent verb complements because they are non-finite clauses.

    "content": ". | Descriptions . | Noun phrase complement clause . | There are two types of noun complement clauses: (1) that-clauses and (2) to-infinitive clauses (pp. 644-645). | (1) that-clauses: There were also [rumors] that Ford had now taken its stake up to the maximum 15 percent allowed. | Here, the that-clause is NOT a complement for the verb, but a complement for the preceding noun (i.e., “adding some descriptive information about that noun”, p.645). | In noun complement that-clauses, the complementizer “that” CANNOT be omitted. | . | (2) to-infinitive clauses: You’ve been given [permission] to wear them. (Note: this is NOT included in the tag, but for reference) | . | . | Noun phrase postmodifiers are different from noun phrase complement clauses (p. 644) . | Peter reached out for the well-thumbed report that lay behind him on the cupboard top.

(NP complement clause; included) | . | . | Tag . | thatcls+ncomp is tagged on the main verb of the that-complement clause. | . | Examples . | The fact that no tracer particles were found indicates that these areas are not a pathway… (from a reference doc/table) | The observation that the species has adapted to urban environments challenges traditional views on wildlife habitat preferences. | The conclusion that global temperatures are rising faster than previously estimated is alarming. | . | . Noun phrase (NP) complements . Earlier discussions on the verb complement clauses have clarified that complement clauses serve as dependent clauses which fulfill the role of completing a verb’s meaning within a sentence. An NP complement is essentially a complement associated with a noun rather than a verb. This notion of NP complementation, as detailed by Haegeman &amp; Guéron (1998, pp.440-441), suggests that just as verbs can take a diverse array of complements ranging from finite to non-finite clauses, nouns too can select finite clauses to complement their meanings. Consider/compare following examples: . | He considers that she deserves a promotion. (verb-complement) | The consideration that she deserves a promotion weighs heavily on his mind. (NP-complement) | She believes that honesty is the best policy. (verb-complement) | Her belief that honesty is the best policy guides her actions. (NP-complement) | . NP modifier vs. NP complement . The relationsip between NP modifers and NP complements are often ambiguous (p.644). NP modifiers serve to describe and modify a noun by supplying additional details about the noun’s characteristics. These modifiers append descriptive information but are not necessary for the grammatical integrity of the noun phrase. In contrast, NP complements are clauses or phrases that furnish complete information, which is crucial to understanding the noun’s full meaning. NP complements are closely linked to the noun and are indispensable for the completeness of the noun phrase. For example, in the sentence His assumption that the work was easy turned out to be wrong, the NP complement clause that the work was easy is essential. Without this complement, the nature of the assumption would remain unclear. ",

    "content": ". | Descriptions . | Extraposed that-clauses utilize a structure where the adjective is part of a statement that often begins with “it” as a subject, slightly detaching the speaker’s or writer’s direct stance from the proposition. This can highlight the proposition itself or present the stance in a more generalized manner, as shown in: . | certainty adjectives: They indicate the extent to which the speaker/writer regards the embedded proposition is probable, accepted, apparent, certain, plain, inevitable. | affective/evaluative adjectives: They mark other assessments or attitudes twoards the proposition in the that-clause: (un)acceptable, preferable, sensible, amazing, bad, funny, dreadful, odd, suprising, neat, advisable, critical, crucial, essential, fitting, obligatory, vital. | hypothetical adjectives: These constructions are marked by should or subjunctive verb forms (e.g: It is preferable that the marked cells [should be] identical in their behaviour to the unmarked cells. (p. 674)) | . | . | Tag . | xtrapos+thatcls+jcomp is tagged on the main verb of the that-complement clause. | . | Examples . | It has been clear for some time that the demands of the arms control process would increasingly dominate military planning. (p. 673) | It is obvious that direct chilling of the udder depends as much on the thermal properties of the floor as on the air temperature. (p. 673) | It’s horrible that he put up with Claire’s nagging. (p. 673) | It is tragic that so many of his generation died as they did. (p. 673) | It is sensible that the breeding animals receive the highest protection. (p. 674) | It is important that it be well sealed from air leakage. (p. 674) | It is vital that leaking water is avoided. (p. 674) | . | Discussions . | It’s only if the sample is so bad, so contradictory to the (null) hypothesis, that we’re going to reject (it). | Q: Is this an ‘extraposed adjective+that-complement’ or a simple ‘adjective+that-complement clause’? Given that the phrase (‘so contradictory that~’) suggests a cause-effect relationship (e.g., it was so bad that I did not want to go there again), how does this affect its classification? | A1: This is not extraposed. The ‘it’ is referential. And so the ‘that’ clause is a adjective + that-complement clause (of the adjective ‘bad’ in this case). | A2 (added 091024-MS): This sounds controversial. See this example: It’s only if the sample is very bad, very contradictory to the (null) hypothesis, that we’re going to reject the argument. To me, that-clause looks like being extraposed. | . | . Adjective phrases . Adjective phrases feature an adjective as the core component, known as the head, and may include additional modifiers. These modifiers can be single words, extended phrases, or even full clauses. Modifiers in an adjective phrase typically intensify or specify the quality of the adjective (e.g., very fortunate, fortunate to meet her; modifiers answer to the question of ‘how fortunate’?). These accompanying elements, known as complements, often consist of prepositional phrases or clauses and serve to provide full meaning to the adjective (p. 101). Adjective complement clauses . Building on the discussion in the verb complement clauses section, complement clauses serve a role in completing the meaning of adjectival predicates within a main clause (p. 658). Both (1) adjective + that-complement clause and (2) extraposed adjective + that-complement clause are included, each conveying stance within three primary semantic domains: degrees of certainty (e.g., certain, confident, evident); affective psychological states (e.g., annoyed, glad, sad); and evaluations of situations, events, etc. (e.g., appropriate, odd, good, important, advisable). These structures, while similar, offer distinct ways of expressing adjectival predicates. ",

    "content": "In contrast to finite dependent clauses, non-finite dependent clauses are distinct from their finite counterparts in that they do not contain a verb phrase marking tense or modality. Therefore, structurally they are more succinct and implicit compared to finite clauses. They typically omit an explicit subject and often do not require a subordinator, which leads to a lack of explicitness and a compact semantic structure. Interpreting a non-finite clause often requires context from the main clause and sometimes from the broader context of the discourse. There are three primary types of non-finite clauses, each characterized by a different form of verb phrase: to-infinitive clauses, ing-clauses, and ed-clauses (pp. 198-201). Below are some examples to compare between non-finite and finite clauses: . ",
