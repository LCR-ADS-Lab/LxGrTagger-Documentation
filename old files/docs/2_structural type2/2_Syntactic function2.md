# 2-2. clause constituent: verb complement

## 2-2-1. verb + *to* complement clause

1. Descriptions
   - Infinitive clauses can have a range of syntactic roles which include direct objects (pp. 198-199).
2. Tag
   - `tocls+vcomp` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *to* complement clause.
3. Examples
    - *I really want <ins>to **fix** this room up</ins>.*
    - *He upset you very much, and I hate <ins>to **see** that</ins>.* (p. 199)
    - *I believe Mary <ins>to **be** innocent</ins>*. (Haegeman & Guéron, 1998, p. 126)
    - *I promised John <ins>to **buy** a new bicycle</ins>*. (Haegeman & Guéron, 1998, p. 35)
4. Discussions
   - An infinitive construction may express either the perfect aspect (e.g., *She seems <ins>to have **completed**</ins> the project on time.*) or the progressive aspect (e.g., *He appears <ins>to be **studying**</ins> for his exams.*). 

## 2-2-2. verb + *ing* complement clause

1. Descriptions
   - Similar to the infinitive clauses, *ing* complement clauses can also act as a complement to the main verb.
   - This structure is commonly known as the gerund. Gerunds function as a hybrid category, possessing characteristics of both verbs and nouns (Haegeman & Guéron, 1998, p.481).
2. Tag
   - `ingcls+vcomp` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *ing* complement clause.
3. Examples
   - *I like <ins>**watching** the traffic go by</ins>.*
   - *I started <ins>**thinking** about Christmas</ins>.* (p. 200)
   - *It's as if the guy never stops <ins>**thinking** about the issue</ins>.* (p.200)
   - *I enjoy <ins>**running** in the morning</ins>.*
   - *He considers <ins>**moving** to a new city</ins>.*
   - *He avoids <ins>**talking** about his problems</ins>.*
4. Discussions
   - Several of the controlling verbs related this tag are not transitive (e.g., **come**, **go**, **stand**, and **sit**). In such cases, the *-ing* clause does not function as a direct object but still acts as a complement to the verb and is therefore tagged as such.
      - *He sat <ins>**waiting** for the bus</ins>.* 
      - *She stood <ins>**staring** at the stars</ins>.*
      - *They went <ins>**running** in the park</ins>.* 
      - *The ship came <ins>**plowing** through the waves</ins>.*
