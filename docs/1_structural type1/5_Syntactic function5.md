# 1-5. other phrase constituent: adjective complement

**adjective phrase**
Adjective phrases feature an adjective as the core component, known as the *head*, and may include additional modifiers. These modifiers can be single words, extended phrases, or even full clauses. 
Modifiers in an adjective phrase typically intensify or specify the quality of the adjective (e.g., *very fortunate*, *fortunate to meet her*- 'how fortunate'?). These accompanying elements, known as *complements*, often consist of prepositional phrases or clauses and serve to provide full meaning to the adjective (p. 101).

**adjective complement**

Building on the discussion in the [verb complement clauses](2.%20Syntactic%20function2.html#1-2-clause-constituent-verb-complement) section, complement clauses serve a role in completing the meaning of adjectival predicates within a main clause (p. 658). Both (1) adjective + *that*-complement clause and (2) extraposed adjective + *that*-complement clause are included, each conveying stance within three primary semantic domains: degrees of certainty (e.g., *certain*, *confident*, *evident*); affective psychological states (e.g., *annoyed*, *glad*, *sad*); and evaluations of situations, events, etc. (e.g., *appropriate*, *odd*, *good*, *important*, *advisable*). These structures, while similar, offer distinct ways of expressing adjectival predicates.

## 1-5-1. adjective + *that*-complement clause

1. Descriptions
    - Post-predicate *that*-clauses feature adjectives that directly precede the clause, typically expressing affective psychological states or personal judgments. This construction emphasizes the subject's direct response or state in relation to the content of the *that*-clause, as illustrated in: (1) levels of certainty (e.g., *certain*, *confident*, *evident*), (2) emotional states (e.g., *annoyed*, *glad*, *sad*), or (3) judgment on events (e.g., *appropriate*, *good*, *important*) (p. 671).
    - We counted the examples with omitted *that* as *that* is frequently omitted in nominal *that*-clauses (pp.660-669).

## 1-5-2. extraposed adjective + *that*-complement clause 

1. Descriptions
    - Extraposed *that*-clauses utilize a structure where the adjective is part of a statement that often begins with "it" as a subject, slightly detaching the speaker's or writer's direct stance from the proposition. This can highlight the proposition itself or present the stance in a more generalized manner, as shown in: 
        - certainty adjectives: They indicate the extent to which the speaker/writer regards the embedded proposition is *probable*, *accepted*, *apparent*, *certain*, *plain*, *inevitable*.
        - affective/evaluative adjectives: They mark other assessments or attitudes twoards the proposition in the *that*-clause: *(un)acceptable*, *preferable*, *sensible*, *amazing*, *bad*, *funny*, *dreadful*, *odd*, *suprising*, *neat*.
        - hypothetical adjectives: These constructions are marked by *should* or subjunctive verb forms (e.g: *It is preferable <ins>that the marked cells [should **be**] identical in their behaviour to the unmarked cells.</ins>* (p. 674))
        - necessity/importance adjectives: They reflect the writer's belief that a proposed course of action is essential or important (e.g., *advisable*, *critical*, *crucial*, *essential*, *fitting*, *obligatory*, *vital*)
