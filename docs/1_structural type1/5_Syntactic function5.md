# 1-5. other phrase constituent: adjective complement

## 1-5-1. adjective + *that*-complement clause

1. Descriptions
    - Post-predicate *that*-clauses feature adjectives that directly precede the clause, typically expressing affective psychological states or personal judgments. This construction emphasizes the subject's direct response or state in relation to the content of the *that*-clause, as illustrated in: (1) levels of certainty (e.g., *certain*, *confident*, *evident*), (2) emotional states (e.g., *annoyed*, *glad*, *sad*), or (3) judgment on events (e.g., *appropriate*, *good*, *important*) (p. 671).
    - We counted the examples with omitted *that* as *that* is frequently omitted in nominal *that*-clauses (pp.660-669).
        -  *I'm amazed <ins>you **know** him.</ins>*
2. Tag
    - `thatcls+jcomp` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *that*-complement clause.
3. Examples
    - *We’re happy <ins>that the hunger strike has **ended**.</ins>*
    - *I'm glad <ins>that I **found** you again.</ins>*
    - *She was pleased <ins>that her family had remembered.</ins>*
4. Discussions
    - Comparative constructions should not be tagged.
    - e.g., *so (ADV) ADJ that...*
        - *It was **so simple that** it will become complex.*
        - *It's only if the sample is **so bad, so contradictory to the hypothesis that** we're going to rejct it* 
        - NOT tag either *become* or *reject* in two examples above.

## 1-5-2. extraposed adjective + *that*-complement clause 

1. Descriptions
    - Extraposed *that*-clauses utilize a structure where the adjective is part of a statement that often begins with "it" as a subject, slightly detaching the speaker's or writer's direct stance from the proposition. This can highlight the proposition itself or present the stance in a more generalized manner, as shown in: 
        - certainty adjectives: They indicate the extent to which the speaker/writer regards the embedded proposition is *probable*, *accepted*, *apparent*, *certain*, *plain*, *inevitable*.
        - affective/evaluative adjectives: They mark other assessments or attitudes twoards the proposition in the *that*-clause: *(un)acceptable*, *preferable*, *sensible*, *amazing*, *bad*, *funny*, *dreadful*, *odd*, *suprising*, *neat*, *advisable*, *critical*, *crucial*, *essential*, *fitting*, *obligatory*, *vital*.
        - hypothetical adjectives: These constructions are marked by *should* or subjunctive verb forms (e.g: *It is preferable <ins>that the marked cells [should **be**] identical in their behaviour to the unmarked cells.</ins>* (p. 674))

2. Tag
    - `xtrapos+thatcls+jcomp` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *that*-complement clause.
3. Examples
    - *It has been clear for some time <ins>that the demands of the arms control process would increasingly **dominate** military planning.</ins>* (p. 673)
    - *It is obvious <ins>that direct chilling of the udder **depends** as much on the thermal properties of the floor as on the air temperature.</ins>* (p. 673)
    - *It's horrible <ins>that he **put up** with Claire's nagging.</ins>* (p. 673)
    - *It is tragic <ins>that so many of his generation **died** as they did.</ins>* (p. 673)
    - *It is sensible <ins>that the breeding animals **receive** the highest protection.</ins>* (p. 674)
    - *It is important <ins>that it **be** well sealed from air leakage.</ins>* (p. 674)
    - *It is vital <ins>that leaking water is **avoided**.</ins>* (p. 674)

4. Discussions
    - *It’s only if the sample is so bad, so contradictory to the (null) hypothesis, <ins>that we’re going to reject (it)</ins>.*
    - **Q:** Is this an ‘extraposed adjective+that-complement’ or a simple ‘adjective+that-complement clause’? Given that the phrase (‘so contradictory that~’) suggests a cause-effect relationship (e.g., it was so bad that I did not want to go there again), how does this affect its classification?
    - **A1:** This is not extraposed. The ‘it’ is referential. And so the ‘that’ clause is a adjective + *that*-complement clause (of the adjective ‘bad’ in this case).
    - **A2 (added 091024-MS):** This sounds controversial. See this example: *It's only if the sample is very bad, very contradictory to the (null) hypothesis, that we're going to reject the argument.* To me, that-clause looks like being extraposed.

**Adjective phrases**

Adjective phrases feature an adjective as the core component, known as the *head*, and may include additional modifiers. These modifiers can be single words, extended phrases, or even full clauses. Modifiers in an adjective phrase typically intensify or specify the quality of the adjective (e.g., *very fortunate*, *fortunate to meet her*; modifiers answer to the question of 'how fortunate'?). These accompanying elements, known as *complements*, often consist of prepositional phrases or clauses and serve to provide full meaning to the adjective (p. 101).

**Adjective complement clauses**

Building on the discussion in the [verb complement clauses](2_Syntactic%20function2.html#1-2-clause-constituent-verb-complement) section, complement clauses serve a role in completing the meaning of adjectival predicates within a main clause (p. 658). Both (1) adjective + *that*-complement clause and (2) extraposed adjective + *that*-complement clause are included, each conveying stance within three primary semantic domains: degrees of certainty (e.g., *certain*, *confident*, *evident*); affective psychological states (e.g., *annoyed*, *glad*, *sad*); and evaluations of situations, events, etc. (e.g., *appropriate*, *odd*, *good*, *important*, *advisable*). These structures, while similar, offer distinct ways of expressing adjectival predicates.
