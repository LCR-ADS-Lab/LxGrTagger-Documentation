# 1-2. clause constituent verb complement

## 1-2-1. verb + *that*-complement clause

1. Descriptions
    - Post-predicate *that*-clauses controlled by verbs are categorized into three domains (see p. 661):
        - Mental verbs: Pertaining to cognition and often including emotive/affective content (e.g., *hope*, *believe*, *feel*, *find*, *guess*, *know*, *see*, *think*, *assume*, *conclude*).
        - Speech act verbs: Specifically denote speech activities (e.g., *say*, *admit*, *agree*, *announce*, *argue*, *bet*, *insist*).
        - Other communication verbs: May not directly involve speech (e.g., *show*, *suggest*, *ensure*, *indicate*, *prove*).
    - Note: There is an absence of an intermediary NP or *to*-NP between the verb and the *that*-clause.
2. Tag
    - The tag `thatcls+vcomp` (indicating a ZERO complementizer) is applied to the **main verb** within the *that*-complement clause.
3. Examples
    - *I didn't agree <ins>that he should be **compelled** to do singing.</ins>* (p. 661)
    - *I suggested <ins>that she **sit** down on the chair and wait.</ins>* (p. 662)
    - *I would hope <ins>that we can **have** more control over them.</ins>* (From Kris' table)
    - *I propose <ins>that Mary should be invited.</ins>* (Haegeman & Guéron, 1998, p.441)


## 1-2-2. verb + *wh*-complement clause 
1. Descriptions
    - *wh*-clauses can be either dependent (1) interrogative clauses or (2) nominal relative clauses (p. 683).
    - Common *wh*-words: what, who, where, when, why, 'how', and whether
    - Types:
        - Interrogative clauses: Used with verbs like *ask* and *wonder* to present indirect questions.
            - e.g., *I wonder <ins>what that could **be** about</ins>.*
        - Nominal relative clauses: Can be paraphrased by a general head noun modified by the *wh*-clause (e.g., *<ins>Whoever solves this problem</ins> will be successful.* → *The person who solves this problem will be successful.*)
            - e.g., *<ins>What **baffles** me</ins> is how few of them can spell.* 
2. Tag
    -  `whcls+vcomp` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *wh*-complement clause.
3. Examples
    - *I don't know <ins>how they **do** it.</ins>*
    - *She showed me <ins>where we should **plant** the tree.</ins>*
    - *He described <ins>what he **saw** at the event.</ins>*
    - *No one knows <ins>how long the journey will **take**.</ins>*
    - *"What I don't understand," she said, "is <ins>why they don't **let** me know anything.</ins>"* (p.193)
    - *that's <ins>how I **did** it.</ins>* (dataset)

**Complements**

Complements are often required to form a grammatically complete and meaningful sentence. Consider the following examples, where grammatically incorrect sentences are indicated (Haegeman & Guéron, 1998, pp. 21-22):

- a. *He abandoned the project.*
- b. *<sup>*</sup>He abandoned.*
- c. *<sup>*</sup>He abandoned after the project.*
- d. *He abandoned the book.*
- e. *He abandoned the project, then the book.*

From these examples, it is clear that the verb *abandon* must be followed by a noun phrase (NP) such as *the project*. If the verb *abandon* is not paired with an NP, the resulting sentence is ungrammatical (b, c). Therefore, to construct a grammatical sentence with the verb *abandon*, it must include a complement of the NP category.

**Verb complement clauses**

Verb complement clauses are dependent clauses that serve to complete the meaning of a verb in a main clause (e.g., *I think <ins>that this doc looks good</ins>*; *that*-clause functions a complement to the verb *think*). These clauses are also called **nominal clauses** because they frequently occupy a noun phrase slot in the sentence, acting as subjects, objects, or predicatives. Depending on the controlling predicate, they can be found in both pre-predicate (subject) and post-predicate (e.g., direct object) positions (For more information, see Chapter 9).

However, complement clauses can also complete the meaning of an adjectival predicate rather than a verb in the main clause (e.g., *I've gotta be careful <ins>that I don't sound too formal</ins>*). Here, the term *predicate* refers to both lexical verbs and copula+adjective combinations capable of governing a complement clause. This aspect will be further explored in the section on [other phrase constituent: adjective complement](5_Syntactic%20function5.html#1-5-other-phrase-constituent_adjective-complement).

There are four types of **verb complement clauses**: (1) *that*-clause, (2) *wh*-clause, (3) *to*-infinitive clause, and (4) *ing*-clause. In this section, types (1) and (2) will be highlighted as complexity features because they are finite clauses, while types (3) and (4) will be discussed in the section on [non-finite clause constituent verb complements](./2_Syntactic%20function2.html/#2-2-clause-constituent-verb-complement).
