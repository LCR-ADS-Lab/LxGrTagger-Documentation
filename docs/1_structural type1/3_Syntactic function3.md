# 1-3. noun phrase constituent: modifier

**Complex noun phrases**

Complex noun phrases typically consist of a sequence of elements: a determiner, any premodifiers, the head noun, and then any postmodification or complementation elements (See Table, adapted from p. 574 and modified).

| Determiner | Premodifiers        | Head Noun     | **Postmodifiers**                           |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|

| an         | ancient oak         | tree          | that has witnessed centuries                |
| the        | last remaining      | specimen      | of a rare species                           |
| some       | innovative teaching | methods       | designed for online learning                |
| several    | handcrafted         | artifacts     | from local artisans                         |
| every      | major               | breakthrough  | in medical research                         |

This section focuses on postmodifiers. For additional details on complex noun phrases, refer to Chapter 8.

**Postmodifiers**

Postmodifiers come in various forms, primarily:

- Relative clauses: *the proposal <ins>she drafted this morning</ins>*
- *ing*-clauses: *the dog <ins>sleeping on the porch</ins>*
- *ed*-clauses: *the message <ins>encoded in the document</ins>*
- *to*-infinitive clauses: *a plan <ins>to renovate the old theater</ins>*
- Prepositional phrases: *the students <ins>from the international program</ins>*
- Noun phrases in apposition: *the novelist <ins>Alice Walker</ins>*

In this discussion of finite clauses serving as postmodifiers, the focus will be on **relative clauses**. The remaining postmodifier types will be addressed in subsequent sections.

## 1-3-1. noun + finite relative clause 

1. Descriptions
    -  A finite relative clause follows the head noun phrase, and are always missing a constituent (corresponds in meaning to the _head noun_)
    -  _Relativizers_ are one of:
        -  Relative pronoun: which, who, whom, whose, that
        -  Relative adverb: where, when, why
        -  Zero relativizer: relativizer is _ommited_
    - Nominal postmodifiers are different from NP complement clauses (p. 644, see the next section on [noun phrase constituent: complement](4_Syntactic%20function4.html#1-4-noun-phrase-constituent-complement))
2. Tag
    - `finite_rel` is tagged on the **main verb** of the *that*- of *wh*- relative clause (also include the relative clause with deleted relative pronoun).
3. Examples
    -  *The lowest pressure ratio <ins>which will **give** an acceptable performance</ins> is always chosen.* (p. 608)
    -  *There are plenty of existing owners <ins>who **are** already keen to make the move.</ins>* (p. 608)
    -  *There was a slight, furtive boy <ins>whom no one **knew**.</ins>* (p.608)

    -  *Well, that's the only way <ins>that this can be definitively **assessed**.</ins>*
