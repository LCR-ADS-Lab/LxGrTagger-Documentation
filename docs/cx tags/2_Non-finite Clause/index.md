# Non-Finite dependent clause
{: .no_toc }

In contrast to [finite dependent clauses](../Finite%20Clause/), non-finite dependent clauses are distinct from their finite counterparts in that they do not contain a verb phrase marking tense or modality. Therefore, structurally they are more succinct and implicit compared to finite clauses. They typically omit an explicit subject and often do not require a subordinator, which leads to a lack of explicitness and a compact semantic structure. Interpreting a non-finite clause often requires context from the main clause and sometimes from the broader context of the discourse. There are three primary types of non-finite clauses, each characterized by a different form of verb phrase: *to*-infinitive clauses, *ing*-clauses, and *ed*-clauses (pp. 198-201). Below are some examples to compare between non-finite and finite clauses:
