# Finite dependent clause
{: .no_toc }

Finite dependent clauses are characterized by their inclusion of a verb phrase that marks a clear tense or modality (pp. 193-198). Typically, finite dependent clauses include a subject unless it's omitted due to ellipsis. These clauses are often introduced by a clause link, such as a subordinator (e.g., *because*, *although*) or a *wh*-word.
