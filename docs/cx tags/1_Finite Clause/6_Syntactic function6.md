   -  *wh*-complement clauses can be compliments of preopositions and objects of prepositional verbs.
   -  *wh*-complements begin with *who*, *what*, *when*, *how*, *where*, *why*, or *which*.
   -  Common prepositions are *in*, *on*, *at*, *by*, with, about, and through
   -  Prepositional verbs are verbs that when combined with a preposition may take on new meaning.

3. Examples

4. Discussions
   - When *wh*-complement clauses are part of a comparative construction, they were not tagged.
      - e.g., *this is the probability of getting **a score bigger than** <ins>what we calculate</ins>.*
   - Q. Should we include *that* clauses? (e.g., *He took comfort in <ins>that he was not alone in his struggles</ins>*; *The scientist found satisfaction in <ins>that her research was making a difference</ins>*)

**Prepositional phrases**

Prepositional phrases are structures that combine a preposition with a complement, typically a noun phrase. This combination extends a noun phrase, creating a link that integrates it into the larger context of a sentence. Examples include *in the morning*, *to him*, *a street with no name*, and *in which she had to be expelled*. Prepositions can be accompanied by nominal clauses (*wh*-complement clause, e.g., *suggestion for <ins>what we need</ins>*) and *ing*-clauses as complements (e.g., *interested in <ins>playing the piano</ins>*) (p. 103).
