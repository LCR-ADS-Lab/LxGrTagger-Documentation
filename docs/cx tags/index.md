# Complexity (cx) tags

The tagging scheme is organized into hierarchical structures:

   1. **Structural type**  
      The highest level of linguistic structure categorization.
   2. **Syntactic function**  
      Classifies elements based on their function within the structural type.
   3. **Complexity feature**  
      The focus of tagging, which includes:
      1. **Descriptions**: Detailed explanations of the complexity features.
      2. **Tag**: Guidelines on where to apply the tag (`TAG NAME`) within the structure.
      3. **Examples**: Examples, where the target complexity feature is <ins>underlined</ins> and the tagging location is highlighted in **bold**.
      4. **Discussions**
