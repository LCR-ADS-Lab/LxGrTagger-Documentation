# Adjective complement

## preposition phrases as adjective complement
1. Descriptions
   - Prepositional phrases can function as adjective complements when they follow an adjective and complete/enhance its meaning.
   - They begin with prepositions, commonly *in*, *about*, *to*, etc.
   - They cannot exist on their own due to being depedent (non-clausal) phrases.
2. Tag
   - `in+jcomp` is tagged on the **preposition** of the complement prepositional phrase. 
3. Examples
   - *The solution was obvious <ins>**to** everyone in the room</ins>.*
   - *She was happy <ins>**about** the promotion</ins>.*
   - *He is interested <ins>**in** ancient history</ins>.*
   - *The novel is relevant <ins>**to** current events</ins>.*
4. Discussions
   - *…two is bigger than point one*
      - **Q:** We understand that the comparative structure is not a typical prepositional phrase as an adjective complement (e.g., I am happy about the solution). However, this structure does still fit the pattern of adjective + preposition (*than*) +noun phrase. Should we include it in this tag, or should comparatives simply be considered a different structure/pattern?
      - **A:** We’d vote for comparatives being a different structure.  There are many different structural options for creating comparatives in English, and they are all idiosyncratic.
