# 2-4. noun phrase constituent: complement 

## 2-4-1. noun + *to* complement clause

1. Descriptions 
   - Noun + *to* complement clauses modify the noun and provide a purpose or potential action related to the noun. For example, in the sentence *His **decision** <ins>to move to New York</ins> was influenced by the promise of better job prospects*, the clause *to move to New York* modifies the noun *decision*, specifying what the decision involves.
   - Noun + *to* complement clauses are non-finite, and have missing subjects that can be reconstructed from the context of the sentence.
   - It is important to distinguish this tag with [noun + *to* relative clause](./3_Syntactic%20function3.md#2_structural%20type2/3_Syntactic%20function3.html#2-3-1-noun--to-relative-clause) tag. 
      - noun + *to* complement: For example, in a sentence *You've been given permission <ins>to wear them</ins>*, the clause *to wear them* is about the permission, defining what it implies but not necessarily needing any particular element from the main clause (*You've been give permission*) to be understood its meaning.
      - noun + *to* relative clause: For example, in a sentence *You're the best person to ask*, the clause *to ask* describes why *You're the best person*, which we can consider that this clause structure is more closely linked to explaining why the previous noun (*person*) is described as such.
