# `2.` Non-finite dependent clauses

In contrast to [finite dependent clauses](../1_structural%20type1/#1-finite-dependent-clauses), non-finite dependent clauses are distinct from their finite counterparts in that they do not contain a verb phrase marked by tense or modality. Their nature is more succinct and implicit compared to finite clauses. These clauses typically omit an explicit subject and often do not require a subordinator, which leads to a lack of explicitness and a compact semantic structure. Interpreting a non-finite clause often requires context from the main clause and sometimes from the broader context of the discourse. There are three primary types of non-finite clauses, each characterized by a different form of verb phrase: *to*-infinitive clauses, *ing*-clauses, and *ed*-clauses. For more information, refer to pp. 198-201. Below are some examples to compare between non-finite and finite:
- Example 1: *to*-infinitive clause
    - Non-finite: *I don't know what <ins>to write in the report</ins>.*
    - Finite: *I don't know what I should write in the report.*
- Example 2: *ing*-clause 
    - Non-finite: *<ins>Reading through the document</ins>, she found several critical errors.*
    - Finite: *<ins>As she was reading through the document</ins>, she found several critical errors.*
- Example 3: *ed*-clause
    - Non-finite: *<ins>Shocked by the news</ins>, he was unable to respond.*
    - Finite: *<ins>Because he was shocked by the news</ins>, he was unable to respond.*

**Subjects in non-finite clauses**

In non-finite clauses, the subject is frequently implicit, inferred from the context rather than explicitly stated. When a subject is expressed within non-finite clauses, it takes the form of a noun phrase. In this case, the subject cannot be a clause and always appears before the verb phrase (p. 125).
- *Do you want [us] <ins>to put them back in</ins>?* 
- *I asked [Mother] <ins>to put his bike in the garage</ins>.* 

## Structural overview

- A **non-finite** dependent clause is characterized by the absence of tense and modality in the verb phrase.
