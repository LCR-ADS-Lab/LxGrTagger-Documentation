## Semi-modals 

The following semi-modals were pre-processed before parsing and tagging sentence structures: *have to, had to, got to, have/had got to, gotta, ought to, BE supposed to, BE going to, gonna, BE about to,* and *used to.*

**Notes:**
- *BE* includes all its inflected forms for person and tense.
- *used to* is treated as a semi-modal only when it is **not** preceded by *BE*.

## Passive

We tagged the **passive** construction, not the *be*-verb itself.

- *They knew <ins>what they were going to be **asked**.</ins>* (verb-*wh*-complement)

## Coordination

### Verb

We tagged the first main verb, not the subsequent verbs.

- *A truck driver <ins>who just **slammed** and kicked at everything</ins>* (noun-finite relative clause)
- *He suggested <ins>that they should **stop** and go</ins>* (verb *that*-complement clause) 

### Clause

We tagged every verb in each clause.

- *He said <ins>he was **tired**</ins></ins> but <ins>he **needed** a break</ins>* (coordinated *that*-complement clauses)

## Multi-words

We defined several lists of fixed multi‚Äêword sequences that are used during the processing of linking adverbs (pp. 558-559; 875-879), prepositions (p. 75), subordinators (pp.842-843).
