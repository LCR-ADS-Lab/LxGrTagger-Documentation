Each token is placed in its own row, with columns describing the token’s form and syntactic function. Here is a brief explanation of the key columns:

- [Cx tags](../cx%20tags): Details about the complexity tags. For instance, you may see tags like nn+npremod (a noun used as a noun-phrase premodifier) or finitecls+rel (a finite relative clause).
- [Sub-Cx tags](../sub-cx%20tags)
   - main tag: Corresponds to POS tags (e.g., *nn* for nouns, *jj* for adjectives).  
   - cat1-9: Each of these columns provides more specific morphological or syntactic information. For example, *cat1* may indicate number or pronoun type in *nn*.
